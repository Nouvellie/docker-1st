## Tips

- Build a basic compose file for a Drupal content management system website. Docker Hub is your friend.
- Use the **drupal** image along with the **postgres** image.
- Use **ports** to expose Drupal on 8080 so you can localhost:8080.
- Be sure to set **POSTGRES_PASSWORD** for postgres.
- Walk though Drupal setup via browser.
- Drupal assumes DB is **localhost**, but it is service name.
- Use volumes to store Drupal unique data.
